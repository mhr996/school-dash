# Tabbed Destinations Section

## Overview

A new standalone component that displays destinations in a tabbed interface with 4 categories:

- **Most Visited Destinations** (Purple theme with fire icon)
- **Top Rated Destinations** (Amber theme with star icon)
- **Latest Destinations** (Blue theme with clock icon)
- **Best Deals** (Emerald theme with shopping bag icon)

## Implementation Strategy

To avoid corrupting the existing file structure, this feature was implemented as a **separate component** that's imported and rendered alongside the existing sections.

## Files Created

- `components/dashboards/tabbed-destinations-section.tsx` - New standalone component

## Files Modified

- `components/dashboards/trip-planner-dashboard.tsx`:
    - Added import for `TabbedDestinationsSection`
    - Added state variables: `mostVisitedDestinations`, `topRatedDestinations`, `latestDestinations`
    - Updated `loadDashboardData()` to derive tab categories from existing data
    - Added component render after Best Deals section

## Features

✅ Smooth tab transitions with AnimatePresence  
✅ Responsive design (2 cols mobile, 4 cols desktop)  
✅ Theme-aware gradients per tab  
✅ Animated destination cards with hover effects  
✅ Property badges and requirements display  
✅ Special "Best Deal" badge with discount percentage  
✅ Empty state handling  
✅ Fully localized (uses existing translation keys)

## Translation Keys Used

Already exist in `public/locales/{en,ae,he}.json`:

- `explore_destinations`
- `most_visited_destinations` / `most_visited`
- `top_rated_destinations` / `top_rated`
- `latest_destinations` / `latest`
- `best_deals` / `deals`
- `view_all`
- `select` / `book_now`
- `per_person`
- `contact_for_price`
- `requirements`
- `no_destinations_found`

## Data Flow

1. Dashboard loads destinations via `loadDashboardData()`
2. Raw destination data is derived into 4 categories:
    - Most Visited: First 8 destinations
    - Top Rated: Alphabetically sorted first 8
    - Latest: ID-sorted (descending) first 8
    - Best Deals: Existing logic (destinations with pricing)
3. Component receives all 4 arrays as props
4. User switches tabs → AnimatePresence handles smooth transitions
5. Click handlers bubble up to parent for modal/selection actions

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Zero risk of file corruption** - existing code untouched  
✅ **Easy to test** - can be toggled on/off by commenting one line  
✅ **Maintainable** - isolated component with clear props interface  
✅ **Reusable** - can be used in other dashboards if needed  
✅ **Preserves existing functionality** - Top Destinations and Best Deals sections still work

## Next Steps (Optional)

- Remove old "Top Destinations" and "Best Deals" sections once confirmed working
- Fetch real rating/visit data from backend for better categorization
- Add loading skeletons for tab content
- Add animation for discount badge on Best Deals tab
