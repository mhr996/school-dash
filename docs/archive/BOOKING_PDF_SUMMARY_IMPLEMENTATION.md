## Usage Example

### From Bookings List (Admin/Manager):

```typescript
// User clicks download icon in table
// System fetches booking + services
// Generates PDF in current language
// Downloads as: booking-{reference}-{date}.pdf
```

### From Booking Preview Page:

```typescript
// User clicks "Download Booking PDF" button
// All data already available on page
// Generates PDF immediately
// Shows success notification
```

## File Naming Convention

Generated PDFs are named using the pattern:

```
booking-{booking_reference}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf
```

Example: `booking-BK-2024-001-2024-10-14.pdf`
