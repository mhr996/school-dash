# Sub-Service Add Page Changes

## Overview

Removed the ability to add sub-services from the "Add" pages for both Entertainment Companies and Education Programs. Users are now redirected to the edit page after creation, where they can add sub-services with icon support.

## Reason for Change

- **UX Issue**: Sub-services require saved database IDs to upload icons
- **Storage Path**: Icons are stored at `[parent_id]/sub-services/[service_id]/icon.ext`
- **Solution**: Create the main service first → redirect to edit page → add sub-services with full icon support

## Changes Made

### 1. Entertainment Companies Add Page

**File**: `app/(defaults)/external-entertainment-companies/add/page.tsx`

#### Removed:

- `handleServiceChange()` - Updated service fields
- `handleDeleteService()` - Removed service from array

- Sub-service database insert code
- Badge count on "Services Provided" tab
- Full table interface for adding services

#### Added:

## New User Workflow

### Before:

1. Navigate to Add page
2. Fill basic information
3. Add sub-services (but can't upload icons)
4. Save
5. Manually navigate to edit page to upload icons

### After:

1. Navigate to Add page
2. Fill basic information
3. See informational message about sub-services
4. Save
5. **Automatically redirected to Edit page**
6. Add sub-services with full icon support

## UI Changes

### Services Provided Tab (Add Pages)

**Old UI**:

- Header with "Add Service" button
- Table with service name and price inputs
- Delete button for each service
- Empty state with "Add First Service" button

**New UI**:

```tsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-center py-16">
    <div className="text-center max-w-md">
        <div className="w-20 h-20 mx-auto mb-4 rounded-full bg-info/10 flex items-center justify-center">
            <IconStar className="w-10 h-10 text-info" />
        </div>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 mb-2">
            Sub-Services Available After Creation
        </h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">
            You will be able to add sub-services and their icons after creating the [service].
            Click "Save" below to create the [service] first.
        </p>
        <div className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-4 py-2 bg-info/10 text-info rounded-lg text-sm">
            <svg><!-- Info icon --></svg>
            <span>You will be redirected to the edit page after saving</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Technical Details

### Redirect Changes

- **Entertainment Companies**:

    - Old: `router.push('/external-entertainment-companies')`
    - New: `router.push(\`/external-entertainment-companies/edit/\${companyId}\`)`

- **Education Programs**:
    - Old: `router.push('/education-programs')`
    - New: `router.push(\`/education-programs/edit/\${programData.id}\`)`

### Database Impact

- No database changes required
- Sub-services are now created only from edit pages
- Icons are uploaded only after sub-service has a database ID

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner UX**: Users understand the workflow - create first, then add details
2. **No Confusion**: No option to add services without icon support
3. **Automatic Redirect**: Users don't need to manually navigate to edit page
4. **Full Feature Support**: All sub-service features (including icons) available in one place
5. **Prevents Errors**: Can't create sub-services without IDs needed for icon storage
