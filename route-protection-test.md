- Route Protection System Test Results
-
- This document outlines the comprehensive route protection system implemented
- for the service provider portal.
-
- IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
-
-   1. RouteGuard Component (components/auth/route-guard.tsx):
-   - Handles all authentication and authorization logic
-   - Protects routes based on user roles and status
-   - Redirects users to appropriate dashboards
-   - Shows AccountPendingPage for inactive service providers
-
-   2. Route Protection Logic:
-   - Public routes: /login, /reset-password, /update-password, /signup
-   - Service provider routes: /service/\* (guides, paramedics, security, travel, entertainment)
-   - Admin routes: All other routes (users, bookings, reports, etc.)
-
-   3. User Role Handling:
-   - Admins: Access all routes except /service/\*
-   - Service Providers: Only access /service/\* routes
-   - Inactive Service Providers: See account pending page
-   - Unauthenticated: Redirected to /login
-
-   4. Integration Points:
-   - DefaultLayout: Wrapped with RouteGuard
-   - App.tsx: Simplified to only handle theme initialization
-   - AccountPendingPage: Shows full-screen pending approval message
-
- TESTING SCENARIOS:
-
-   1. Unauthenticated User:
-   - Accessing /users → Redirect to /login
-   - Accessing /service/dashboard → Redirect to /login
-   - Accessing /login → Allow access
-
-   2. Admin User:
-   - Accessing /users → Allow access
-   - Accessing /service/dashboard → Redirect to /
-   - Accessing /login when authenticated → Redirect to /
-
-   3. Active Service Provider:
-   - Accessing /users → Redirect to /service/dashboard
-   - Accessing /service/dashboard → Allow access
-   - Accessing /login when authenticated → Redirect to /service/dashboard
-
-   4. Inactive Service Provider:
-   - Accessing any route → Show AccountPendingPage with contact admin message
-   - Cannot access admin routes until approved
-
- SECURITY FEATURES:
-
-   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
-   - Route-level protection
-   - Automatic redirection based on user status
-   - Clean separation between admin and service provider interfaces
-   - Account approval workflow for new service providers
-
- STATUS: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
-
- All route protection logic has been successfully implemented and integrated
- into the application architecture.
