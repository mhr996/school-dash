# Entertainment Company Image Upload Enhancement

## Overview

Replaced the image URL text input with a proper image upload component and preview for better UX in the entertainment company edit page.

## Changes Made

### File: `components/entertainment/entertainment-company-tabs.tsx`

#### 1. Added Import

- Imported `ImageUpload` component from `@/components/image-upload/image-upload`

#### 2. Replaced Image URL Field

**Before:**

- Simple text input for image URL
- No preview of current image
- Manual URL entry required

**After:**

- Integrated `ImageUpload` component with file picker
- Image preview showing current company image (128x128px)
- Automatic upload to Supabase storage (`entertainment-companies` bucket)
- Success/error notifications on upload
- Fallback image support
- Supported formats displayed: JPG, PNG, GIF

#### 3. Enhanced UI Features

- **Image Preview**: Shows current image in a 128x128px rounded container with border
- **Upload Button**: Clear "Upload Image" button with loading state
- **Feedback Messages**: Success/error alerts on upload completion
- **Error Handling**: Fallback to placeholder image if load fails
- **Grid Layout**: Organized in a responsive grid with status field

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users can now directly upload images instead of finding and pasting URLs
2. **Image Preview**: Visual confirmation of the current image before/after upload
3. **Automatic Storage**: Images are automatically stored in Supabase storage
4. **Validation**: Only image files (JPG, PNG, GIF) are accepted
5. **Responsive Design**: Works well on mobile and desktop
6. **Consistent Pattern**: Uses the same `ImageUpload` component as other parts of the app

## Storage Bucket

- **Bucket Name**: `entertainment-companies`
- **File Path**: `{companyId}/{timestamp}.{ext}`
- **Cleanup**: Old images are automatically deleted when new ones are uploaded

## Usage

When editing an entertainment company:

1. Navigate to the "Basic Information" tab
2. See the current company image preview (if exists)
3. Click "Upload Image" button
4. Select an image file from your device
5. Image is automatically uploaded and preview updates
6. Save changes to persist the new image URL to the database

## Technical Details

- Component: `ImageUpload` from `components/image-upload/image-upload.tsx`
- Storage: Supabase Storage bucket `entertainment-companies`
- Image constraints: JPG, PNG, GIF formats
- Unique filename: `{companyId}/{timestamp}.{extension}`
- Auto-cleanup: Previous images deleted on new upload
