# Zones Filter Addition - Trip Planner Dashboard

## Overview

Added a zones filter to the trip planner dashboard destinations view, positioned above the Destination Properties filter section.

## Changes Made

### 1. State Management

**File:** `components/dashboards/trip-planner-dashboard.tsx`

Added new state for selected zones:

```typescript
const [selectedZones, setSelectedZones] = useState<string[]>([]);
```

### 2. Filter Logic

Updated the filter effect to include zone filtering:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    let filtered = destinations;

    if (selectedZones.length > 0) {
        filtered = filtered.filter((dest) => dest.zone_id && selectedZones.includes(dest.zone_id));
    }

    if (selectedProperties.length > 0) {
        filtered = filtered.filter((dest) => dest.properties?.some((prop) => selectedProperties.includes(prop)) ?? false);
    }

    if (selectedSuitableFor.length > 0) {
        filtered = filtered.filter((dest) => dest.suitable_for?.some((suitable) => selectedSuitableFor.includes(suitable)) ?? false);
    }

    setFilteredDestinations(filtered);
}, [destinations, selectedProperties, selectedSuitableFor, selectedZones]);
```

### 3. Toggle Function

Added toggle function for zone selection:

```typescript
const toggleZoneFilter = (zoneId: string) => {
    setSelectedZones((prev) => (prev.includes(zoneId) ? prev.filter((z) => z !== zoneId) : [...prev, zoneId]));
};
```

### 4. UI Component

Added zones filter section in the filters area (positioned above Destination Properties):

**Features:**

- Purple color theme to differentiate from other filters
- Location pin icon
- Responsive grid layout (2 columns on mobile, 3 on tablet, 4 on desktop)
- Animated buttons with scale and fade effects
- Selected state with checkmark indicator
- Shadow effects on selected items

**Visual Design:**

- Header: Purple icon with "Zones" label
- Buttons: Toggle between gray (unselected) and purple (selected)
- Checkmark: Green circle with white checkmark on selected items
- Hover effects: Border color changes to purple

### 5. Translations

All translations already existed in the system:

- **English:** "Zones" (`zones`)
- **Hebrew:** "◊ê◊ñ◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù" (`zones`)
- **Arabic:** "ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿßÿ∑ŸÇ" (`zones`)

## Filter Order

1. üü£ **Zones** (NEW)
2. üîµ **Destination Properties**
3. üü¢ **Suitable For**

## User Experience

### How It Works

1. User can select one or multiple zones
2. Destinations are filtered to show only those in selected zones
3. Filters work cumulatively with property and suitable-for filters
4. Deselecting all zones shows all destinations

### Visual Feedback

- Selected zones have purple background
- Green checkmark appears on selected items
- Smooth animations on selection/deselection
- Clear visual distinction from other filter types

## Technical Details

### Filter Behavior

- **Multiple Selection:** Users can select multiple zones simultaneously
- **Cumulative Filtering:** Zones filter works together with other filters
- **AND Logic:** Destinations must match zone filter AND property filters AND suitable-for filters
- **Empty State:** When no zones selected, no zone filtering is applied

### Performance

- Filters are applied reactively using React useEffect
- Minimal re-renders due to proper dependency array
- Animation delays staggered for smooth appearance

## Files Modified

1. `components/dashboards/trip-planner-dashboard.tsx` - Added state, logic, and UI
