# Services Field Removal - Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully removed all references to the deprecated `services` JSON column from the bookings table across the entire application. The application now exclusively uses the normalized `booking_services` table for storing and managing booking services.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251004000002_drop_services_column.sql`

- Created migration to drop the `services` column from the `bookings` table
- Added table comments documenting the new structure

### 2. Frontend Updates

#### A. Bookings Detail Page (`app/(defaults)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`)

- **Before**: Parsed services from JSON field, with fallback logic for string vs array
- **After**:
    - Fetches services from `booking_services` table
    - Enriches service data by querying service names from respective tables (guides, paramedics, etc.)
    - Stores services in separate state variable
    - Updated TypeScript interface to use `booking_services` array

**Changes**:

- Removed JSON parsing logic
- Added query to `booking_services` table
- Added service enrichment logic to fetch names
- Updated interface: removed `services` field, added `booking_services` optional field
- Added separate `services` state variable for enriched service data

#### B. Bookings Edit Page (`app/(defaults)/bookings/edit/[id]/page.tsx`)

- **Before**:
    - Read from both JSON field and booking_services table (dual support)
    - Saved services to JSON field
- **After**:
    - Exclusively reads from `booking_services` table
    - Saves services directly to `booking_services` table (delete + insert pattern)

**Changes**:

- Removed fallback to JSON field when fetching
- Updated save logic to use `booking_services` table:
    1. Delete existing services for the booking
    2. Insert new services
- Removed `services` field from update payload
- Removed JSON parsing logic

#### C. Reports Page (`app/(defaults)/reports/page.tsx`)

- **Before**: Iterated over `booking.services` JSON array to calculate service performance
- **After**: Uses `booking.booking_services` array from the relationship query

**Changes**:

- Updated service performance calculation to use `booking_services` data structure
- Changed from `booking.services` to `booking.booking_services`
- Updated field names: `cost` → `booked_price`, `type` → `service_type`, `id` → `service_id`

#### D. My Bookings Page (`app/(defaults)/my-bookings/page.tsx`)

- **Before**: Used `booking.services.selected_services` nested structure
- **After**: Uses `booking.booking_services` flat array

**Changes**:

- Updated query to fetch `booking_services(*)`
- Updated interface to replace `services` object with `booking_services` array
- Updated service count display logic
- Updated modal service breakdown to show booking_services data
- Simplified service display (shows service_type, quantity, days, rate_type, booked_price)

### 3. TypeScript Interface Updates

#### Booking Interfaces Updated:

1. **BookingDetails** (bookings/[id]/page.tsx):

    - Removed: `services: Array<{...}>`
    - Added: `booking_services?: Array<{...}>`

2. **Booking** (my-bookings/page.tsx):
    - Removed: `services?: { selected_services?: Array<{...}>; created_from?: string; }`
    - Added: `booking_services?: Array<{...}>`

## Data Flow

### Before:

```
Booking Creation → services JSON field
Booking Display → Parse JSON → Display
Booking Edit → Parse JSON → Edit → Save to JSON
```

### After:

```
Booking Creation → booking_services table (normalized rows)
Booking Display → Query booking_services → Enrich with service names → Display
Booking Edit → Query booking_services → Edit → Delete old + Insert new
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Normalization**: Services are now properly normalized in their own table
2. **Type Safety**: Consistent data structure across all queries
3. **Query Performance**: Can join and filter on service properties
4. **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure service references are valid
5. **Flexibility**: Easier to add service-specific metadata
6. **Reporting**: Can aggregate and analyze services independently

## Migration Steps

To apply these changes:

1. **Verify** all application code is updated (✅ Complete)
2. **Test** the application thoroughly with existing data
3. **Backup** your database
4. **Run migration**:
    ```bash
    npx supabase migration up
    ```

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This is a breaking change if:

- You have external systems reading the `services` JSON field
- You have custom SQL queries that reference `bookings.services`
- You have database triggers or functions using the services field

## Rollback Plan

If needed, you can rollback by:

1. Creating a migration to add the services column back
2. Running a data migration to populate it from booking_services table
3. Reverting code changes

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create new booking with services
- [ ] View booking details page
- [ ] Edit existing booking services
- [ ] View reports page (service performance)
- [ ] View my-bookings page
- [ ] Verify service counts are accurate
- [ ] Test booking confirmation and tax invoice generation
- [ ] Verify all service types (guides, paramedics, security, entertainment)
